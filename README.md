## Abstract 
Our project utilizes RESTful APIs and a Bootstrap framework to create a login-based trivia game website. After registering for the site, users are able to play practice trivia questions on their own or play games with other users. There are two multiplayer modes: PVP and Team Relay. Users can choose to face off 1v1 in PVP to compete for money and points, or they can choose to play as a team in Team Relay. Leaderboards are created based on the score that users accumulate. The money obtained by users can be used to buy packs from the store, which contain collectible pictures that users can set as their profile picture.
