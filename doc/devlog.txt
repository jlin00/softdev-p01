From the reading, we learned a very important skill that will be very useful for us to master, for this project and all future CS endeavors. That skill is having the ability to criticize, critique, and even make fun of your own code. As the reading describes, often programmers will build an unhealthy connection to their code. Combined with an unnecessary ego, they may make excuses when their code doesn't work as intended, or just outright ignore errors. As a result, the reading suggests programmers following an egoless programming workflow. This way, even if your program doesn't work, you should "accept [your] humanity - [your] inability to function like a machine - and [value it]." Instead of dodging errors, learning to embrace them and use them as a learning experience for the future is something that will help all devos. This piece of information will definitely be extremely useful to our group. As amateur programmers (not that more skilled programmers would not make this mistake either), we often make errors and get stuck on certain algorithms. Instead of trying to hide these roadblocks and just barreling past them to get to the next problem, we definitely need to get better at stopping and letting go of our egos. Some actions we will take as a team:
- Asking other members of the team to read the code we write and help debug
- Leaving comments in the code we write so that other members of the team can understand it easily
